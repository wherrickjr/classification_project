    "# Customer Churn Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Telco is a world renowned telecommunications company that provides phone, internet, and streaming services to their customers. As technology evolves, so does the company's business model. In order to stay up to date on current market trends and ensuring the satisfaction of our customers, it is necessary to analyze customer data. As you will soon see, there may be some factors that influence customer churn that can be remediated to keep customers with the company.  Different models are ran to determine what factors have the greatest influence on customer churn and the results will hopefully spark discussion on how to decrease customer churn."
